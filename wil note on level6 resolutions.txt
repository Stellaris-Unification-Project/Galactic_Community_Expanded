there are MANY, MANY places in the code that refer to specific levels of resolutions being active


e.g. in common
colony types
policies
living standards
slavery types
citizen types
starbase modules
starbase buildings
missions
casus belli
special decisions
projects utopia
federation decisions
resource buildings
research buildings
scripted effects

e.g. in events
crisis events
FEDERATIONS EVENTS
on action events
planet destruction events

beyond the aforementioned greater good edict

(those were just ones i found by searching for is_active_resolution, and then ignoring the ones that only had to do with tiyanki)

it's honestly so much that we might just want to consider nuking the level 6 resolutions entirely. to account for all that a LOT needs to be overwritten
